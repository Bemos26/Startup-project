            who are we?
        </h2>
       
        <p class="mission-statement">
            Over the past years, we have seen students, parents and
            teachers struggle to connect.
            Students often do not have a platform to learn from.
            Teachers on the other hand do not have a platform to
            showcase what they have got and parents are unable to
            easily monitor their children's progress. 
            As EduRahisi therefore, we have seen it prudent to provide a 3 in 1
            platform where all these things can happen. EduRahisi is more than 
            just a platform - it is a community dedicated to making education more 
            inclusive, engaging and effective; shaping the mentality
            of learners and the future of learning
